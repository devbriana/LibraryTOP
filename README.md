Full Stack JavaScript Course — Library Project

## Overview
This is a simple **JavaScript-based library management app** that allows users to keep track of their books. Users can add books, edit book information, delete books, hover to view reading status, and expand book cards for full book details. The app is styled to look like a bookshelf.

- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the library with a delete button.
- **Expand Book Cards**: Each book card can expand to show full details while dimming other books.
- **Hover Info**: Hovering over a book icon shows quick info (pages or reading status) using a JavaScript prototype function.
- **Reading Status**: Books can be categorized as `Completed`, `In Progress`, or `To Read`, with color-coded cards.
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Books are arranged in a responsive grid that adapts to screen size.
